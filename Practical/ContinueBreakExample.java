/*
The continue statement in Java is used to skip the remaining code
within a loop iteration and proceed to the next iteration.
It is primarily used to control the flow of a loop and 
selectively skip certain iterations based on a condition.

/*
Ques.Write a the program that asks the user for the number of iterations 
they want to perform. It then uses a for loop to iterate from 1 
to the specified number of iterations.
